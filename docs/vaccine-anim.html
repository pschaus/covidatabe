  	This animation shows the percentage of vaccinated people at hospital
  	assuming an efficiency for the vaccine and in function of the fraction of the population vaccinated in the population.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	This is a simulation based on the assumption that the unvaccinated group is identical in all respects to that of the vaccinated except for the vaccination status, which does not correspond to reality. We therefore cannot infer real efficacy using this tool.
